# Giphy

This is an assignment I did to during the second half of the U of U Full Stack Development Bootcamp. The purpose of this assignment was to practice working with ajax and the GIPHY API. 

This project is live on https://jacobugath.github.io/Giphy/

I wanted to find to create an easy way to find Giphs of my favorite characters from my favorite TV show. You can start playing the game by hitting any Button. Add additional characters from the office, but the must be real office characters and be formated correctly.

This app uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of my choice. I chose a theme using Gifs from my favorite TV show 'The Office' To finish this task, I had to call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML the site. 

Jacobugath maintains the project create an issue for new feature requests or bugs
